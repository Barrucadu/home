# Test data:
# length = 1, breadth = 1, cpsm = 0:   should return "The cost per square metre cannot be zero."
# length = 1, breadth = 0, cpsm = 1:   should return "The breadth of the room cannot be zero."
# length = 0, breadth = 1, cpsm = 1:   should return "The length of the room cannot be zero."

# Class:        13R
# Program Name: carpetfitting
# Desc:         A method was required to calculate the area of carpet required for a room, and the cost of that carpet.
# Design:       1) Get length, breadth, cpsm.
#               2) Check none equal to 0.
#               3) Calculate area, cost
#               4) Print values.
# Evaluation:   Works properly. Easy to use (direct, clear instructions provided). Has clear error reporting. Could be improved by looking until sane data is entered.
