# Change "provide" to "give" or "offer"; "demonstrate" to "show" or "prove"; "modify" to "change".

# This sentence is necessarily about possibility, the event happens in
# some cases but not others, and these cases are hard to predict.  I
# found most of the hedging complaints were similar, but that may just
# be due to the paper I ran it on.

# "The tool is based on testing" ("is based" is passive).

# "The tool uses testing" would be a less-passive alternative, but
# testing is really the core concept, so it doesn't have the same
# nuance.  "The tool extensively uses testing" is just a longer way of
# saying the original sentence.
