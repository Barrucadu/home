    <p> <I>After observing a contradiction between the 'official' ideology defined 

      by open-source licenses and the actual behavior of hackers, we examine the 

      actual customs which regulate the ownership and control of open-source software. 

      We discover that they imply an underlying theory of property rights homologous 

      to the Lockean theory of land tenure. We relate that to an analysis of the 

      hacker culture as a 'gift culture' in which participants compete for prestige 

      by giving time, energy, and creativity away. We then examine the implications 

      of this analysis for conflict resolution in the culture, and develop some 

      prescriptive implications.</I>

    <h2>An Introductory Contradiction</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>Anyone who watches the busy, tremendously productive world of Internet 

      open-source software for a while is bound to notice an interesting contradiction 

      between what open-source hackers say they believe and the way they actually 

      behave - between the official ideology of the open-source culture and its 

      actual practice.</p>

    <p>Cultures are adaptive machines. The open-source culture is a response to 

      an identifiable set of drives and pressures. As usual, the culture's adaptation 

      to its circumstances manifests both as conscious ideology and as implicit, 

      unconscious or semi-conscious knowledge. And, as is not uncommon, the unconscious 

      adaptations are partly at odds with the conscious ideology.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we will dig around the roots of that contradiction, and 

      use it to discover those drives and pressures. We will deduce some interesting 

      things about the hacker culture and its customs. We will conclude by suggesting 

      ways in which the culture's implicit knowledge can be leveraged better.</p>

    <h2>The Varieties of Hacker Ideology</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>The ideology of the Internet open-source culture (what hackers say they 

      believe) is a fairly complex topic in itself. All members agree that open 

      source (that is, software which is freely re-distributable and can readily 

      be evolved and modified to fit changing needs) is a good thing and worthy 

      of significant and collective effort. This agreement effectively defines 

      membership in the culture. However, the reasons individuals and various 

      subcultures give for this belief vary considerably.</p>

    <p>One degree of variation is zealotry; whether open source development is 

      regarded merely as a convenient means to an end (good tools and fun toys 

      and an interesting game to play) or as an end in itself.</p>

    <p>A person of great zeal might say "Free software is my life! I exist to 

      create useful, beautiful programs and information resources, and then give 

      them away." A person of moderate zeal might say "Open source is a good thing 

      which I am willing to spend significant time helping happen." A person of 

      little zeal might say "Yes, open source is OK sometimes. I play with it 

      and respect people who build it."</p>

    <p>Another degree of variation is in hostility to commercial software and/or 

      the companies perceived to dominate the commercial software market.</p>

    <p>A very anti-commercial person might say "Commercial software is theft and 

      hoarding. I write free software to end this evil." A moderately anti-commercial 

      person might say "Commercial software in general is OK because programmers 

      deserve to get paid, but companies that coast on shoddy products and throw 

      their weight around are evil." A commercial person might say "Commercial 

      software is OK, I just use and/or write open-source software because I like 

      it better."</p>

    <p>All nine of the attitudes implied by the cross-product of the above categories 

      are represented in the open-source culture. The reason it is worthwhile 

      to point out the distinctions is because they imply different agendas, and 

      different adaptive and cooperative behaviors.</p>

    <p>Historically, the most visible and best-organized part of the hacker culture 

      has been both very zealous and very anti-commercial. The <a

href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> (FSF) founded by Richard 

      M. Stallman (RMS) supported a great deal of open-source development from 

      the early 1980s on, including tools like Emacs and GCC which are still basic 

      to the Internet open-source world, and seem likely to remain so for the 

      forseeable future.</p>

    <p>For many years the FSF was the single most important focus of open-source 

      hacking, producing a huge number of tools still critical to the culture. 

      The FSF was also long the only sponsor of open source with an institutional 

      identity visible to outside observers of the hacker culture. They effectively 

      defined the term 'free software', deliberately giving it a confrontational 

      weight (which the newer label '<a

href="http://www.opensource.org">open source</a>' just as deliberately avoids).</p>

    <p>Thus, perceptions of the hacker culture from both within and outside it 

      tended to identify the culture with the FSF's zealous attitude and perceived 

      anti-commercial aims (RMS himself denies he is anti-commercial, but his 

      program has been so read by most people, including many of his most vocal 

      partisans). The FSF's vigorous and explicit drive to "Stamp Out Software 

      Hoarding!" became the closest thing to a hacker ideology, and RMS the closest 

      thing to a leader of the hacker culture.</p>

    <p>The FSF's license terms, the <a

href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">"General Public Licence"</a> (GPL), 

      expresses the FSF's zealous and anti-commercial attitudes. It is very widely 

      used in the open-source world. North Carolina's <a

href="http://www.sunsite.unc.edu/">Sunsite</a> is the largest and most popular 

      software archive in the Linux world. In July 1997 about half the Sunsite 

      software packages with explicit license terms used GPL.</p>

    <p>But the FSF was never the only game in town. There was always a quieter, 

      less confrontational and more market-friendly strain in the hacker culture. 

      The pragmatists were loyal not so much to an ideology as to a group of engineering 

      traditions founded on early open-source efforts which predated the FSF. 

      These traditions included, most importantly, the intertwined technical cultures 

      of Unix and the pre-commercial Internet.</p>

    <p>The typical pragmatist attitude is only moderately anti-commercial, and 

      its major grievance against the corporate world is not 'hoarding' per se. 

      Rather it is that world's perverse refusal to adopt superior approaches 

      incorporating Unix and open standards and open-source software. If the pragmatist 

      hates anything, it is less likely to be 'hoarders' in general than the current 

      King of the software establishment (formerly IBM, now Microsoft).</p>

    <p>To pragmatists, the GPL is important as a tool rather than an end in itself. 

      Its main value is not as a weapon against 'hoarding', but as a tool for 

      encouraging software sharing and the growth of <a

href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar">bazaar-mode</a> development 

      communities. The pragmatist values having good tools and toys more than 

      he dislikes commercialism, and may use high-quality commercial software 

      without ideological discomfort. At the same time, his open-source experience 

      has taught him standards of technical quality that very little closed software 

      can meet.</p>

    <p>For many years, the pragmatist point of view expressed itself within the 

      hacker culture mainly as a stubborn current of refusal to completely buy 

      into the GPL in particular or the FSF's agenda in general. Through the 1980s 

      and early 1990s, this attitude tended to be associated with fans of Berkeley 

      Unix, users of the BSD license, and the early efforts to build open-source 

      Unixes from the BSD source base. These efforts, however, failed to build 

      bazaar communities of significant size, and became seriously fragmented 

      and ineffective.</p>

    <p>Not until the Linux explosion of early 1993-1994 did pragmatism find a 

      real power base. Although Linus Torvalds never made a point of opposing 

      RMS, he set an example by looking benignly on the growth of a commercial 

      Linux industry, by publicly endorsing the use of high-quality commercial 

      software for specific tasks, and by gently deriding the more purist and 

      fanatical elements in the culture.</p>

    <p>A side effect of the rapid growth of Linux was the induction of a large 

      number of new hackers for which Linux was their primary loyalty and the 

      FSF's agenda primarily of historical interest. Though the newer wave of 

      Linux hackers might describe the system as "the choice of a GNU generation", 

      most tended to emulate Torvalds more than Stallman.</p>

    <p>Increasingly it was the anti-commercial purists who found themselves in 

      a minority. How much things had changed would not become apparent until 

      the <a href="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html">Netscape 

      announcement</a> in January 1998 that it would distribute Navigator 5.0 

      in source. This excited more interest in 'free software' within the corporate 

      world. The subsequent call to the hacker culture to exploit this unprecedented 

      opportunity and to re-label its product from 'free software' to 'open source' 

      was met with a level of instant approval that surprised everybody involved.</p>

    <p>In a reinforcing development, the pragmatist part of the culture was itself 

      becoming polycentric by the mid-1990s. Other semi-independent communities 

      with their own self-consciousness and charismatic leaders began to bud from 

      the Unix/Internet root stock. Of these, the most important after Linux was 

      the Perl culture under Larry Wall. Smaller, but still significant, were 

      the traditions building up around John Osterhout's Tcl and Guido Van Rossum's 

      Python languages. All three of these communities expressed their ideological 

      independence by devising their own, non-GPL licensing schemes.</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d3"></a> </h2>

    <h2>Promiscuous Theory, Puritan Practice</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>Through all these changes, nevertheless, there remained a broad consensus 

      theory of what 'free software' or 'open source' is. The clearest expression 

      of this common theory can be found in the various open-source licenses, 

      all of which have crucial common elements.</p>

    <p>In 1997 these common elements were distilled into the Debian Free Software 

      Guidelines, which became the <a

href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Definition</a>. Under the guidelines 

      defined by the OSD, an open-source license must protect an unconditional 

      right of any party to modify (and redistribute modified versions of) open-source 

      software.</p>

    <p>Thus, the implicit theory of the OSD (and OSD-conforming licenses such 

      as the GPL, the BSD license, and Perl's Artistic License) is that anyone 

      can hack anything. Nothing prevents half a dozen different people from taking 

      any given open-source product (such as, say the Free Software Foundations's 

      gcc C compiler), duplicating the sources, running off with them in different 

      evolutionary directions, but all claiming to be <em>the</em> product.</p>

    <p>In practice, however, such 'forking' almost never happens. Splits in major 

      projects have been rare, and always accompanied by re-labeling and a large 

      volume of public self-justification. It is clear that, in such cases as 

      the GNU Emacs/XEmacs split, or the gcc/egcs split, or the various fissionings 

      of the BSD splinter groups, that the splitters felt they were going against 

      a fairly powerful community norm.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="raym1.gif" width="309" height="135"></p>

    <p>In fact (and in contradiction to the anyone-can-hack-anything consensus 

      theory) the open-source culture has an elaborate but largely unrecognized 

      set of ownership customs. These customs regulate who can modify software, 

      the circ umstances under which it can be modified, and (especially) who 

      has the right to redistribute modified versions back to the community.</p>

    <p>The taboos of a culture throw its norms into sharp relief. Therefore, it 

      will be useful later on if we summarize some important ones here.</p>

    <p>

    <ul>

      <li>There is strong social pressure against forking projects. It does not 

        happen except under plea of dire necessity, with much public self-justification, 

        and with a renaming.</li>

      <p>

      <li>Distributing changes to a project without the cooperation of the moderators 

        is frowned upon, except in special cases like essentially trivial porting 

        fixes.</li>


      <p>

      <li>Removing a person's name from a project history, credits or maintainer 

        list is absolutely <em>not done</em> without the person's explicit consent.</li>

    </ul>

    <p></p>

    <p>In the remainder of this paper, we shall examine these taboos and ownership 

      customs in detail. We shall inquire not only into how they function but 

      what they reveal about the underlying social dynamics and incentive structures 

      of the open-source community.</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d4"></a> </h2>

    <p> 

    <h2>Ownership and Open Source</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>What does 'ownership' mean when property is infinitely reproducible, highly 

      malleable, and the surrounding culture has neither coercive power relationships 

      nor material scarcity economics?</p>

    <p>Actually, in the case of the open-source culture this is an easy question 

      to answer. The owner(s) of a software project are those who have the exclusive 

      right, recognized by the community at large, to <em>re-distribute modified 

      versions</em> [<a href="#01">1</a>].</p>

    <p>According to the standard open-source licenses, all parties are equals 

      in the evolutionary game. But in practice there is a very well-recognized 

      distinction between 'official' patches, approved and integrated into the 

      evolving software by the publicly recognized maintainers, and 'rogue' patches 

      by third parties. Rogue patches are unusual, and generally not trusted [<a href="#02">2</a>].</p>

    <p>That <em>public</em> redistribution is the fundamental issue is easy to 

      establish. Custom encourages people to patch software for personal use when 

      necessary. Custom is indifferent to people who redistribute modified versions 

      within a closed user or development group. It is only when modifications 

      are posted to the open-source community in general, to compete with the 

      original, that ownership becomes an issue.</p>

    <p>There are, in general, three ways to acquire ownership of an open-source 

      project. One, the most obvious, is to found the project. When a project 

      has only one maintainer since its inception and the maintainer is still 

      active, custom does not even permit a <em>question</em> as to who owns the 

      project.</p>

    <p>The second way is to have ownership of the project handed to you by the 

      previous owner (this is sometimes known as 'passing the baton'). It is well 

      understood in the community that project owners have a duty to pass projects 

      to competent successors when they are no longer willing or able to invest 

      needed time in development or maintenance work.</p>

    <p>It is significant that in the case of major projects, such transfers of 

      control are generally announced with some fanfare. While it is unheard of 

      for the open-source community at large to actually interfere in the owner's 

      choice of succession, customary practice clearly incorporates a premise 

      that public legitimacy is important.</p>

    <p>For minor projects, it is generally sufficient for a change history included 

      with the project distribution to note the change of ownership. The clear 

      presumption is that if the former owner has not in fact voluntarily transferred 

      control, he or she may reassert control with community backing by objecting 

      publicly within a reasonable period of time.</p>

    <p>The third way to acquire ownership of a project is to observe that it needs 

      work and the owner has disappeared or lost interest. If you want to do this, 

      it is your responsibility to make the effort to find the owner. If you don't 

      succeed, then you may announce in a relevant place (such as a Usenet newsgroup 

      dedicated to the application area) that the project appears to be orphaned, 

      and that you are considering taking responsibility for it.</p>

    <p>Custom demands that you allow some time to pass before following up with 

      an announcement that you have declared yourself the new owner. In this interval, 

      if someone else announces that they have been actually working on the project, 

      their claim trumps yours. It is considered good form to give public notice 

      of your intentions more than once. More points for good form if you announce 

      in many relevant forums (related newsgroups, mailing lists); and still more 

      if you show patience in waiting for replies. In general, the more visible 

      effort you make to allow the previous owner or other claimants to respond, 

      the better your claim if no response is forthcoming.</p>

    <p>If you have gone through this process in sight of the project's user community, 

      and there are no objections, then you may claim ownership of the orphaned 

      project and so note in its history file. This, however, is less secure than 

      being passed the baton, and you cannot expect to be considered fully legitimate 

      until you have made substantial improvements in the sight of the user community.</p>

    <p>I have observed these customs in action for twenty years, going back to 

      the pre-FSF ancient history of open-source software. They have several very 

      interesting features. One of the most interesting is that most hackers have 

      followed them without being fully aware of doing so. Indeed, the above may 

      be the first conscious and reasonably complete summary ever to have been 

      written down.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="raym2.gif" width="227" height="159"></p>

    <p>Another is that, for unconscious customs, they have been followed with 

      remarkable (even astonishing) consistency. I have observed the evolution 

      of literally hundreds of open-source projects, and I can still count the 

      number of significant violations I have observed or heard about on my fingers.</p>

    <p>Yet a third interesting feature is that as these customs have evolved over 

      time, they have done so in a consistent direction. That direction has been 

      to encourage more public accountability, more public notice, and more care 

      about preserving the credits and change histories of projects in ways which 

      (among other things) establish the legitimacy of the present owners.</p>

    <p>These features suggest that the customs are not accidental, but are products 

      of some kind of implicit agenda or generative pattern in the open-source 

      culture that is utterly fundamental to the way it operates.</p>

    <p>An early respondent pointed out that contrasting the Internet hacker culture 

      with the cracker/pirate culture (the "warez d00dz" centered around game-cracking 

      and pirate bulletin-board systems) illuminates the generative patterns of 

      both rather well. We'll return to the d00dz for contrast later in the paper.</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d5"></a> </h2>

    <p> 

    <p> 

    <h2>Locke and Land Title</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>To understand this generative pattern, it helps to notice a historical 

      analogy for these customs that is far outside the domain of hackers' usual 

      concerns. As students of legal history and political philosophy may recognize, 

      the theory of property they imply is virtually identical to the Anglo-American 

      common-law theory of land tenure.</p>

    <p>In this theory, there are three ways to acquire ownership of land.</p>

    <p>On a frontier, where land exists that has never had an owner, one can acquire 

      ownership by <em>homesteading,</em> mixing one's labor with the unowned 

      land, fencing it, and defending one's title.</p>

    <p>The usual means of transfer in settled areas is <em>transfer of title,</em> 

      that is receiving the deed from the previous owner. In this theory, the 

      concept of 'chain of title' is important. The ideal proof of ownership is 

      a chain of deeds and transfers extending back to when the land was originally 

      homesteaded.</p>

    <p>Finally, the common-law theory recognizes that land title may be lost or 

      abandoned (for example, if the owner dies without heirs, or the records 

      needed to establish chain of title to vacant land are gone). A piece of 

      land that has become derelict in this way may be claimed by <em>adverse 

      possession</em> - one moves in, improves it, and defends title as if homesteading.</p>

    <p>This theory, like hacker customs, evolved organically in a context where 

      central authority was weak or nonexistent. It developed over a period of 

      a thousand years from Norse and Germanic tribal law. Because it was systematized 

      and rationalized in the early modern era by the English political philosopher 

      John Locke, it is sometimes referred to as the 'Lockean' theory of property.</p>

    <p>Logically similar theories have tended to evolve wherever property has 

      high economic or survival value and no single authority is powerful enough 

      to force central allocation of scarce goods. This is true even in the hunter-gatherer 

      cultures that are sometimes romantically thought to have no concept of 'property'. 

      For example, in the traditions of the !Kung San bushmen of the Kalahari 

      Desert, there is no ownership of hunting grounds. But there <em>is</em> 

      ownership of water holes and springs under a theory recognizably akin to 

      Locke's.</p>

    <p>The !Kung San example is instructive, because it shows that Lockean property 

      customs arise only where the expected return from the resource exceeds the 

      expected cost of defending it. Hunting grounds are not property because 

      the return from hunting is highly unpredictable and variable, and (although 

      highly prized) not a necessity for day-to-day survival. Water holes, on 

      the other hand, are vital to survival and small enough to defend.</p>

    <p>The 'noosphere' of this paper's title is the territory of ideas, the space 

      of all possible thoughts [<a href="#03">3</a>]. What we see implied in hacker 

      ownership customs is a Lockean theory of property rights in one subset of 

      the noosphere, the space of all programs. Hence 'homesteading the noosphere', 

      which is what every founder of a new open-source project does.</p>

    <p><a href="mailto:rideau@ens.fr">Fare Rideau</a> correctly points out that 

      hackers do not exactly operate in the territory of pure ideas. He asserts 

      that hackers really only own <em>programming projects</em> - intense focus 

      points of material labor (development, service, etc); reputation, trustworthiness, 

      and other individual traits are then associated with these projects. He 

      asserts that the space spanned by hacker projects, is <em>not</em> the noosphere 

      but a sort of dual of it, the space of noosphere-exploring program projects. 

      With a nod to astrophysicists, it would be etymologically correct to call 

      this dual space the 'ergosphere' or 'sphere of work'.</p>

    <p>In practice, the distinction between noosphere and ergosphere is not important 

      for the purposes of this paper. It is dubious whether the 'noosphere' in 

      the pure sense Fare insists on can be said to exist in any meaningful way; 

      one would almost have to be a Platonist philosopher to believe in it. And 

      the distinction between noosphere and ergosphere is only of <em>practical</em> 

      importance if one wishes to assert that ideas (the elements of the noosphere) 

      cannot be owned, but their instantiations as projects can. This question 

      leads to issues in the theory of intellectual property which are beyond 

      the scope of this paper.</p>

    <p>To avoid confusion, however, it is important to note that neither the noosphere 

      nor the ergosphere is the same as the totality of virtual locations in electronic 

      media that is sometimes (to the disgust of most hackers) called 'cyberspace'. 

      Property there is regulated by completely different rules that are closer 

      to those of the material substratum - essentially, he who owns the media 

      and machines on which a part of 'cyberspace' is hosted owns that piece of 

      cyberspace as a result.</p>

    <p>The Lockean structure suggests strongly that open-source hackers observe 

      the customs they do in order to defend some kind of expected return from 

      their effort. The return must be more significant than the effort of homesteading 

      projects, the cost of maintaining version histories that document 'chain 

      of title', and the time cost of doing public notifications and a waiting 

      period before taking adverse possession of an orphaned project.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the 'yield' from open source must be something more than simply 

      the use of the software, something else that would be compromised or diluted 

      by forking. If use were the only issue, there would be no taboo against 

      forking, and open-source ownership would not resemble land tenure at all. 

      In fact, this alternate world (where use is the only yield) is the one implied 

      by existing open-source licenses.</p>

    <p>We can eliminate some candidate kinds of yield right away. Because you 

      can't coerce effectively over a network connection, seeking power is right 

      out. Likewise, the open-source culture doesn't have anything much resembling 

      money or an internal scarcity economy, so hackers cannot be pursuing anything 

      very closely analogous to material wealth.</p>

    <p>There is one way that open-source activity can help people become wealthier, 

      however - a way that provides a valuable clue to what actually motivates 

      it. Occasionally, the reputation one gains in the hacker culture can spill 

      over into the real world in economically significant ways. It can get you 

      a better job offer, or a consulting contract, or a book deal.</p>

    <p>This kind of side effect, however, is at best rare and marginal for most 

      hackers; far too much so to make it convincing as a sole explanation, even 

      if we ignore the repeated protestations by hackers that they're doing what 

      they do not for money but out of idealism or love.</p>

    <p>However, the way such economic side-effects are mediated is worth examination. 

      Below we'll see that an understanding of the dynamics of reputation within 

      the open-source culture <em>itself</em> has considerable explanatory power</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d6"></a></h2>

    <h2>The Hacker Culture as Gift Economy</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>To understand the role of reputation in the open-source culture, it is 

      helpful to move from history further into anthropology and economics, and 

      examine the difference between <em>exchange cultures</em> and <em>gift cultures.</em></p>

    <p>Humans have an innate drive to compete for social status; it's wired in 

      by our evolutionary history. For most human history before the invention 

      of agriculture, our ancestors lived in small nomadic hunting-gathering bands. 

      High-status individuals got the healthiest mates and access to the best 

      food. This drive for status expresses itself in different ways, depending 

      largely on the degree of scarcity of survival goods.</p>

    <p>Most ways humans have of organizing are adaptations to scarcity and want. 

      Each way carries with it different ways of gaining social status.</p>

    <p>The simplest way is the <em>command hierarchy.</em> In command hierarchies, 

      allocation of scarce goods is done by one central authority and backed up 

      by force. Command hierarchies scale very poorly [<a

href="#04">4</a>]; they become increasingly brutal and inefficient as they get 

      larger. For this reason, command hierarchies above the size of an extended 

      family are almost always parasites on a larger economy of a different type. 

      In command hierarchies, social status is primarily determined by access 

      to coercive power.</p>

    <p>Our society is predominantly an <em>exchange economy.</em> This is a sophisticated 

      adaptation to scarcity that, unlike the command model, scales quite well. 

      Allocation of scarce goods is done in a decentralized way through trade 

      and voluntary cooperation (and in fact, the dominating effect of competitive 

      desire is to produce cooperative behavior). In an exchange economy, social 

      status is primarily determined by having control of things (not necessarily 

      material things) to use or trade.</p>

    <p>Most people have implicit mental models for both of the above, and how 

      they interact with each other. Government, the military, and organized crime 

      (for example) are command hierarchies parasitic on the broader exchange 

      economy we call 'the free market'. There's a third model, however, that 

      is radically different from either and not generally recognized except by 

      anthropologists; the <em>gift culture.</em></p>

    <p>Gift cultures are adaptations not to scarcity but to abundance. They arise 

      in populations that do not have significant material-scarcity problems with 

      survival goods. We can observe gift cultures in action among aboriginal 

      cultures living in ecozones with mild climates and abundant food. We can 

      also observe them in certain strata of our own society, especially in show 

      business and among the very wealthy.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="raym3.gif" width="367" height="227"></p>

    <p>Abundance makes command relationships difficult to sustain and exchange 

      relationships an almost pointless game. In gift cultures, social status 

      is determined not by what you control but by <em>what you give away.</em></p>

    <p>Thus the Kwakiutl chieftain's potlach party. Thus the multi-millionaire's 

      elaborate and usually public acts of philanthropy. And thus the hacker's 

      long hours of effort to produce high-quality open source.</p>

    <p>Examined in this way, it is quite clear that the society of open-source 

      hackers is in fact a gift culture. Within it, there is no serious shortage 

      of the 'survival necessities' - disk space, network bandwidth, computing 

      power. Software is freely shared. This abundance creates a situation in 

      which the only available measure of competitive success is reputation among 

      one's peers.</p>

    <p>This observation is not in itself entirely sufficient to explain the observed 

      features of hacker culture, however. The cracker d00dz have a gift culture 

      which thrives in the same (electronic) media as that of the hackers, but 

      their behavior is very different. The group mentality in their culture is 

      much stronger and more exclusive than among hackers. They hoard secrets 

      rather than sharing them; one is much more likely to find cracker groups 

      distributing sourceless executables that crack software than tips that give 

      away how they did it.</p>

    <p>What this shows, in case it wasn't obvious, is that there is more than 

      one way to run a gift culture. History and values matter. I have summarized 

      the history of the hacker culture elsewhere [<a href="#05">5</a>]; the ways 

      in which it shaped present behavior are not mysterious. Hackers have defined 

      their culture by set of choices about the <em>form</em> which their competition 

      will take. It is that form which we will examine in the remainder of this 

      paper.</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d7"></a> </h2>

    <p> 

    <h2>The Joy of Hacking</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>In making this 'reputation game' analysis, by the way, I do not mean to 

      devalue or ignore the pure artistic satisfaction of designing beautiful 

      software and making it work. We all experience this kind of satisfaction 

      and thrive on it. People for whom it is not a significant motivation never 

      become hackers in the first place, just as people who don't love music never 

      become composers.</p>

    <p>So perhaps we should consider another model of hacker behavior in which 

      the pure joy of craftsmanship is the primary motivation. This 'craftsmanship' 

      model would have to explain hacker custom as a way of maximizing both the 

      opportunities for craftsmanship and the quality of the results. Does this 

      conflict with or suggest different results than the 'reputation game' model?</p>

    <p>Not really. In examining the 'craftsmanship' model, we come back to the 

      same problems that constrain hackerdom to operate like a gift culture. How 

      can one maximize quality if there is no metric for quality? If scarcity 

      economics doesn't operate, what metrics are available besides peer evaluation? 

      It appears that any craftsmanship culture ultimately must structure itself 

      through a reputation game - and, in fact, we can observe exactly this dynamic 

      in many historical craftsmanship cultures from the medieval guilds onwards.</p>

    <p>In one important respect, the 'craftsmanship' model is weaker than the 

      'gift culture' model; by itself, it doesn't help explain the contradiction 

      we initially described at the start of this paper.</p>

    <p>Finally, the 'craftsmanship' motivation itself may not be psychologically 

      as far removed from the reputation game as we might like to assume. Imagine 

      your beautiful program locked up in a drawer and never used again. Now imagine 

      it being used effectively and with pleasure by many people. Which dream 

      gives you satisfaction?</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, we'll keep an eye on the craftsmanship model. It is intuitively 

      appealing to many hackers, and explains some aspects of individual behavior 

      well enough.</p>

    <p>After I published the first version of this paper, an anonymous respondent 

      commented: "You may not work to get reputation, but the reputation is a 

      real payment with consequences if you do the job well." This is a subtle 

      and important point. The reputation incentives continue to operate whether 

      or not a craftsman is aware of them; thus, ultimately, whether or not a 

      hacker understands his own behavior as part of the reputation game, his 

      behavior will be shaped by that game.</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d8"></a></h2>

    <h2>The Many Faces of Reputation</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>There are reasons general to every gift culture why peer repute (prestige) 

      is worth playing for.</p>

    <p>First and most obviously, good reputation among one's peers is a primary 

      reward. We're wired to experience it that way for evolutionary reasons touched 

      on earlier. Many people learn to redirect their drive for prestige into 

      various sublimations that have no obvious connection to a visible peer group, 

      such as "honor", "ethical integrity", "piety", etc.; this does not change 

      the underlying mechanism.</p>

    <p>Secondly, prestige is a good way (and in a pure gift economy, the <em>only</em> 

      way) to attract attention and cooperation from others. If one is well known 

      for generosity, intelligence, fair dealing, leadership ability, or other 

      good qualities, it becomes much easier to persuade other people that they 

      will gain by association with you.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, if your gift economy is in contact with or intertwined with an 

      exchange economy or a command hierarchy, your reputation may spill over 

      and earn you higher status there.</p>

    <p>Beyond these general reasons, the peculiar conditions of the hacker culture 

      make prestige even more valuable than it would be in a 'real world' gift 

      culture.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="raym4.gif" width="307" height="249"></p>

    <p>The main 'peculiar condition' is that the artifacts one gives away (or, 

      interpreted another way, are the visible sign of one's gift of energy and 

      time) are very complex. Their value is nowhere near as obvious as that of 

      material gifts or exchange-economy money. It is much harder to objectively 

      distinguish a fine gift from a poor one. Accordingly, the success of a giver's 

      bid for status is delicately dependent on the critical judgement of peers.</p>

    <p>Another peculiarity is the relative purity of the open-source culture. 

      Most gift cultures are compromised - either by exchange-economy relationships 

      such as trade in luxury goods, or by command-economy relationships such 

      as family or clan groupings. No significant analogues of these exist in 

      the open-source culture; thus, ways of gaining status other than by peer 

      repute are virtually absent.</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d9"></a> </h2>

    <h2>Ownership Rights and Reputation Incentives</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>We are now in a position to pull together the previous analyses into a 

      coherent account of hacker ownership customs. We understand the yield from 

      homesteading the noosphere now; it is peer repute in the gift culture of 

      hackers, with all the secondary gains and side-effects that implies.</p>

    <p>From this understanding, we can analyze the Lockean property customs of 

      hackerdom as a means of <em>maximizing reputation incentives;</em> of ensuring 

      that peer credit goes where it is due and does not go where it is not due.</p>

    <p>The three taboos we observed above make perfect sense under this analysis. 

      One's reputation can suffer unfairly if someone else misappropriates or 

      mangles one's work; these taboos (and related customs) attempt to prevent 

      this from happening.</p>

    <p>

    <ul>

      <li>Projects that fork into several states (or "children") are bad because 

        it exposes pre-fork contributors to a reputation risk that they can only 

        control by being active in all states (or children) simultaneously. This 

        would generally be too confusing or difficult to be practical.</li>

      <p></p>

      <p>

      <li>Distributing rogue patches (or, much worse, rogue binaries) exposes 

        the owners to an unfair reputation risk. Even if the official code is 

        perfect, the owners will catch flak from bugs in the patches (but see 

        [<a

href="#02">2</a>]).</li>

      <p></p>

      <p>

      <li>Surreptitiously filing someone's name off a project is, in cultural 

        context, one of the ultimate crimes. It steals the victim's gift to be 

        presented as the thief's own.</li>

    </ul>

    <p></p>

    <p>All three of these taboo behaviors inflict global harm on the open-source 

      community as well as local harm on the victim(s). Implicitly they damage 

      the entire community by decreasing each potential contributor's perceived 

      likelihood that gift/productive behavior will be rewarded.</p>

    <p>It's important to note that there are alternate candidate explanations 

      for two of these three taboos.</p>

    <p>First, hackers often explain their antipathy to forking projects by bemoaning 

      the wasteful duplication of work it would imply as the child products evolved 

      in more-or-less parallel into the future. They may also observe that forking 

      tends to split the co-developer community, leaving both child projects with 

      fewer brains to work with than the parent.</p>

    <p>A respondent has pointed out that it is unusual for more than one offspring 

      of a fork to survive with significant 'market share' into the long term. 

      This strengthens the incentives for all parties to cooperate and avoid forking, 

      because it's hard to know in advance who will be on the losing side and 

      see a lot of their work either disappear entirely or languish in obscurity.</p>

    <p>Dislike of rogue patches is often explained by observing that they can 

      complicate bug-tracking enormously, and inflict work on maintainers who 

      have quite enough to do catching their <em>own</em> mistakes.</p>

    <p>There is considerable truth to these explanations, and they certainly do 

      their bit to reinforce the Lockean logic of ownership. But while intellectually 

      attractive, they fail to explain why so much emotion and territoriality 

      gets displayed on the infrequent occasions that the taboos get bent or broken 

      - not just by the injured parties, but by bystanders and observers who often 

      react quite harshly. Cold-blooded concerns about duplication of work and 

      maintenance hassles simply do not sufficiently explain the observed behavior.</p>

    <p>Then, too, there is the third taboo. It's hard to see how anything but 

      the reputation-game analysis can explain this. The fact that this taboo 

      is seldom analyzed much more deeply than "It wouldn't be fair" is revealing 

      in its own way, as we shall see in the next section.</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d10"></a> </h2>

    <h2>The Problem of Ego</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>At the beginning of the paper I mentioned that the unconscious adaptive 

      knowledge of a culture is often at odds with its conscious ideology. We've 

      seen one major example of this already in the fact that Lockean ownership 

      customs have been widely followed despite the fact that they violate the 

      stated intent of the standard licenses.</p>

    <p>I have observed another interesting example of this phenomenon when discussing 

      the reputation-game analysis with hackers. This is that many hackers resisted 

      the analysis and showed a strong reluctance to admit that their behavior 

      was motivated by a desire for peer repute or, as I incautiously labeled 

      it at the time, 'ego satisfaction'.</p>

    <p>This illustrates an interesting point about the hacker culture. It consciously 

      distrusts and despises egotism and ego-based motivations; self-promotion 

      tends to be mercilessly criticized, even when the community might appear 

      to have something to gain from it. So much so, in fact, that the culture's 

      'big men' and tribal elders are required to talk softly and humorously deprecate 

      themselves at every turn in order to maintain their status. How this attitude 

      meshes with an incentive structure that apparently runs almost entirely 

      on ego cries out for explanation.</p>

    <p>A large part of it, certainly, stems from the generally negative Europo-American 

      attitude towards 'ego'. The cultural matrix of most hackers teaches them 

      that desiring ego satisfaction is a bad (or at least immature) motivation; 

      that ego is at best an eccentricity tolerable only in prima-donnas and often 

      an actual sign of mental pathology. Only sublimated and disguised forms 

      like "peer repute", "self-esteem", "professionalism" or "pride of accomplishment" 

      are generally acceptable.</p>

    <p>I could write an entire other essay on the unhealthy roots of this part 

      of our cultural inheritance, and the astonishing amount of self-deceptive 

      harm we do by believing (against all the evidence of psychology and behavior) 

      that we ever have truly 'selfless' motives. Perhaps I would, if Friedrich 

      Wilhelm Nietzsche and Ayn Rand had not already done an entirely competent 

      job (whatever their other failings) of deconstructing 'altruism' into unacknowledged 

      kinds of self-interest.</p>

    <p>But I am not doing moral philosophy or psychology here, so I will simply 

      observe one minor kind of harm done by the belief that ego is evil, which 

      is this: it has made it emotionally difficult for many hackers to consciously 

      understand the social dynamics of their own culture.</p>

    <p>But we are not quite done with this line of investigation. The surrounding 

      culture's taboo against visibly ego-driven behavior is so much intensified 

      in the hacker (sub)culture that one must suspect it of having some sort 

      of special adaptive function for hackers. Certainly the taboo is weaker 

      among many other gift cultures, such as the peer cultures of theater people 

      or the very wealthy. 

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d11"></a> </h2>

    <h2>The Value of Humility</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>Having established that prestige is central to the hacker culture's reward 

      mechanisms, we now need to understand why it has seemed so important that 

      this fact remain semi-covert and largely unadmitted.</p>

    <p>The contrast with the pirate culture is instructive. In that culture, status-seeking 

      behavior is overt and even blatant. These crackers seek acclaim for releasing 

      "zero-day warez" (cracked software redistributed on the day of the original 

      uncracked version's release) but are closemouthed about how they do it. 

      These magicians don't like to give away their tricks. And, as a result, 

      the knowledge base of the cracker culture as a whole increases only slowly.</p>

    <p>In the hacker community, by contrast, one's work is one's statement. There's 

      a very strict meritocracy (the best craftsmanship wins) and there's a strong 

      ethos that quality should (indeed <em>must</em>) be left to speak for itself. 

      The best brag is code that "just works", and that any competent programmer 

      can see is good stuff. Thus, the hacker culture's knowledge base increases 

      rapidly.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="raym5.gif" width="303" height="107"></p>

    <p>A taboo against ego-driven posturing therefore increases productivity. 

      But that's a second-order effect; what is being directly protected here 

      is the quality of the information in the community's peer-evaluation system. 

      That is, boasting or self-importance is suppressed because it behaves like 

      noise tending to corrupt the vital signals from experiments in creative 

      and cooperative behavior.</p>

    <p>The hacker culture's medium of gifting is intangible, its communications 

      channels are poor at expressing emotional nuance, and face-to-face contact 

      among its members is the exception rather than the rule. This gives it a 

      lower tolerance of noise than most other gift cultures, and goes a long 

      way to explain the example in public humility required of its tribal elders.</p>

    <p>Talking softly is also functional if one aspires to be a maintainer of 

      a successful project; one must convince the community that one has good 

      judgement, because most of the maintainer's job is going to be judging other 

      people's code. Who would be inclined to contribute work to someone who clearly 

      can't judge the quality of their own code, or whose behavior suggests they 

      will attempt to unfairly hog the reputation return from the project? Potential 

      contributors want project leaders with enough humility and class be able 

      to say, when objectively appropriate, "Yes, that does work better than my 

      version, I'll use it" - and to give credit where credit is due.</p>

    <p>Yet another reason for humble behavior is that in the open source world, 

      you seldom want to give the impression that a project is 'done'. This might 

      lead a potential contributor not to feel needed. The way to maximize your 

      leverage is to be humble about the state of the program. If one does one's 

      bragging through the code, and then says "Well shucks, it doesn't do x, 

      y, and z, so it can't be that good", patches for x, y, and z will often 

      swiftly follow.</p>

    <p>Finally, I have personally observed that the self-deprecating behavior 

      of some leading hackers reflects a real (and not unjustified) fear of becoming 

      the object of a personality cult. Linus Torvalds and Larry Wall both provide 

      clear and numerous examples of such avoidance behavior. Once on a dinner 

      expedition with Larry Wall I joked "You're the alpha hacker here - you get 

      to pick the restaurant." He flinched audibly. And rightly so; failing to 

      distinguish their shared values from their leaders has ruined a good many 

      communities, a pattern of which he and Linus cannot fail to be fully aware. 

      On the other hand, most hackers would love to have Larry's problem, if they 

      could but bring themselves to admit it.

    <h2>Global Implications of the Reputation-Game Model</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>The reputation-game analysis has some more implications that may not be 

      immediately obvious. Many of these derive from the fact that one gains more 

      prestige from founding a successful project than from cooperating in an 

      existing one. One also gains more from projects which are strikingly innovative, 

      as opposed to being 'me, too' incremental improvements on software that 

      already exists. On the other hand, software that nobody but the author understands 

      or has a need for is a non-starter in the reputation game, and it's often 

      easier to attract good notice by contributing to an existing project than 

      it is to get people to notice a new one. Finally, it's much harder to compete 

      with an already successful project than it is to fill an empty niche.</p>

    <p>Thus, there's an optimum distance from one's neighbors (the most similar 

      competing projects). Too close and one's product will be a 'me, too!' of 

      limited value, a poor gift (one would be better off contributing to an existing 

      project). Too far away, and nobody will be able to use, understand, or perceive 

      the relevance of one's effort (again, a poor gift). This creates a pattern 

      of homesteading in the noosphere that rather resembles that of settlers 

      spreading into a physical frontier - not random, but like a diffusion-limited 

      fractal wave. Projects tend to get started to fill functional gaps near 

      the frontier.</p>

    <p>Some very successful projects become 'category killers'; nobody wants to 

      homestead anywhere near them because competing against the established base 

      for the attention of hackers would be too hard. People who might otherwise 

      found their own distinct efforts end up, instead, adding extensions for 

      these big, successful projects. The classic 'category killer' example is 

      GNU Emacs; its variants fill the ecological niche for a fully-programmable 

      editor so completely that nobody has even attempted a truly different design 

      since the early 1980s. Instead, people write Emacs modes.</p>

    <p>Globally, these two tendencies (gap-filling and category-killers) have 

      driven a broadly predictable trend in project starts over time. In the 1970s 

      most of the open source that existed was toys and demos. In the 1980s the 

      push was in development and Internet tools. In the 1990s the action shifted 

      to operating systems. In each case, a new and more difficult level of problems 

      was attacked when the possibilities of the previous one had been nearly 

      exhausted.</p>

    <p>This trend has interesting implications for the near future. In early 1998, 

      Linux looks very much like a category-killer for the niche 'free operating 

      systems' - people who might otherwise write competing OSs are now writing 

      Linux device drivers and extensions instead. And most of the lower-level 

      tools the culture ever imagined having as open-source already exist. What's 

      left?</p>

    <p>Applications. As the year 2000 approaches, it seems safe to predict that 

      open-source development effort will increasingly shift towards the last 

      virgin territory - programs for non-techies. A clear early indicator is 

      the developmentof <a href="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a>, the Photoshop-like 

      image workshop that is open source's first major application with the kind 

      of end-user-friendly GUI interface considered de rigeur in commercial applications 

      for the last decade. Another is the amount of buzz surrounding application-toolkit 

      projects like <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> and <a

href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>.</p>

    <p>Finally, the reputation-game analysis explains the oft-cited dictum that 

      you do not become a hacker by calling yourself a hacker - you become a hacker 

      when <em>other hackers</em> call you a hacker. A 'hacker', considered in 

      this light, is somebody who has shown (by contributing gifts) that he or 

      she both has technical ability and understands how the reputation game works. 

      This judgement is mostly one of awareness and acculturation, and can only 

      be delivered by those already well inside the culture.</p>

    <p> 

    <h2>Noospheric Property and the Ethology of Territory</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>To understand the consequences of property customs, it will help us to 

      look at them from yet another angle; that of animal ethology, specifically 

      the ethology of territory.</p>

    <p>Property is an abstraction of animal territoriality, which evolved as a 

      way of reducing intra-species violence. By marking his bounds, and respecting 

      the bounds of others, a wolf diminishes his chances of being in a fight 

      which could weaken or kill him and make him less reproductively successful.</p>

    <p>Similarly, the function of property in human societies is to prevent inter-human 

      conflict by setting bounds that clearly separate peaceful behavior from 

      aggression. It is sometimes fashionable to describe human property as an 

      arbitrary social convention, but this is dead wrong. Anybody who has ever 

      owned a dog who barked when strangers came near its owner's property has 

      experienced the essential continuity between animal territoriality and human 

      property. Our domesticated cousins of the wolf are instinctively smarter 

      about this than a good many human political theorists.</p>

    <p>Claiming property (like marking territory) is a performative act, a way 

      of declaring what boundaries will be defended. Community support of property 

      claims is a way to minimize friction and maximize cooperative behavior. 

      These things remain true even when the "property claim" is much more abstract 

      than a fence or a dog's bark, even when it's just the statement of the project 

      maintainer's name in a README file. It's still an abstraction of territoriality, 

      and (like other forms of property) our instinct-founded models of property 

      are territorial ones evolved to assist conflict resolution.</p>

    <p>This ethological analysis at first seems very abstract and difficult to 

      relate to actual hacker behavior. But it has some important consequences. 

      One is in explaining the popularity of World Wide Web sites, and especially 

      why open-source projects with Web sites seem so much more 'real' and substantial 

      than those without them.</p>

    <p>Considered objectively, this seems hard to explain. Compared to the effort 

      involved in originating and maintaining even a small program, a Web page 

      is easy, so it's hard to consider a Web page evidence of substance or unusual 

      effort.</p>

    <p>Nor are the functional characteristics of the Web itself sufficient explanation. 

      The communication functions of a Web page can be as well or better served 

      by a combination of an FTP site, a mailing list, and Usenet postings. In 

      fact it's quite unusual for a project's routine communications to be done 

      over the Web rather than via a mailing list or newsgroup. Why, then, the 

      popularity of Web sites as project homes?</p>

    <p>The metaphor implicit in the term 'home page' provides an important clue. 

      While founding an open-source project is a territorial claim in the noosphere 

      (and customarily recognized as such) it is not a terribly compelling one 

      on the psychological level. Software, after all, has no natural location 

      and is instantly reproducible. It's assimilable to our instinctive notions 

      of 'territory' and 'property', but only after some effort.</p>

    <p>A project home page concretizes an abstract homesteading in the spac e 

      of possible programs by expressing it as 'home' territory in the more spatially-organized 

      realm of the World Wide Web. Descending from the noosphere to 'cyberspace' 

      doesn't get us all the way to the real world of fences and barking dogs 

      yet, but it does hook the abstract property claim more securely to our instinctive 

      wiring about territory. And this is why projects with Web pages seem more 

      'real'.</p>

    <p>This ethological analysis also encourages us to look more closely at mechanisms 

      for handling conflict in the open-source culture. It leads us to expect 

      that, in addition to maximizing reputation incentives, ownership customs 

      should also have a role in preventing and resolving conflicts.</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d14"></a> </h2>

    <h2>Causes of Conflict</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>In conflicts over open-source software we can identify four major issues:</p>

    <p>

    <ul>

      <li>Who gets to make binding decisions about a project?</li>

      <p></p>

      <p>

      <li> Who gets credit or blame for what?</li>

      <p></p>

      <p>

      <li> How to reduce duplication of effort and prevent rogue versions from 

        complicating bug tracking?</li>

      <p></p>

      <p>

      <li> What is the Right Thing, technically speaking?</li>

    </ul>

    <p></p>

    <p>If we take a second look at the "What is the Right Thing" issue, however, 

      it tends to vanish. For any such question, either there is an objective 

      way to decide what is accepted by all parties or there isn't. If there is, 

      the game is over and everybody wins. If there isn't, it reduces to "who 

      decides?"</p>

    <p>Accordingly, the three problems a conflict-resolution theory has to resolve 

      about a project are (A) where the buck stops on design decisions, (B) how 

      to decide which contributors are credited and how, and (C) how to keep a 

      project group and product from fissioning into multiple branches.</p>

    <p>The role of ownership customs in resolving issues (A) and (C) is clear. 

      Custom affirms that the owners of the project make the binding decisions. 

      We have previously observed that custom also exerts heavy pressure against 

      dilution of ownership by forking.</p>

    <p>It's instructive to notice that these customs make sense even if one forgets 

      the reputation game and examines them from within a pure 'craftmanship' 

      model of the hacker culture. In this view these customs have less to do 

      with the dilution of reputation incentives than with protecting a craftsman's 

      right to execute his vision in his chosen way.</p>

    <p>The craftsmanship model is not, however, sufficient to explain hacker customs 

      about issue (B), who gets credit for what (because a pure craftsman, one 

      unconcerned with the reputation game, would have no motive to care). To 

      analyze these, we need to take the Lockean theory one step further and examine 

      conflicts and the operation of property rights <em>within</em> projects 

      as well as <em>between</em> them.</p>

    <p><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d15"></a> </p>

    <h2>Project Structures and Ownership</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>The trivial case is that in which the project has a single owner/maintainer. 

      In that case there is no possible conflict. The owner makes all decisions 

      and collects all credit and blame. The only possible conflicts are over 

      succession issues - who gets to be the new owner if the old one disappears 

      or loses interest. The community also has an interest, under issue (C), 

      in preventing forking. These interests are expressed by a cultural norm 

      that an owner/maintainer should publicly hand title to someone if he or 

      she can no longer maintain the project.</p>

    <p>The simplest non-trivial case is when a project has multiple co-maintainers 

      working under a single 'benevolent dictator' who owns the project. Custom 

      favors this mode for group projects; it has been shown to work on projects 

      as large as the Linux kernel or Emacs, and solves the "who decides" problem 

      in a way that is not obviously worse than any of the alternatives.</p>

    <p>Typically, a benevolent-dictator organization evolves from an owner-maintainer 

      organization as the founder attracts contributors. Even if the owner stays 

      dictator, it introduces a new level of possible disputes over who gets credited 

      for what parts of the project.</p>

    <p>In this situation, custom places an obligation on the owner/dictator to 

      credit contributors fairly (through, for example, appropriate mentions in 

      README or history files). In terms of the Lockean property model, this means 

      that by contributing to a project you earn part of its reputation return 

      (positive or negative).</p>

    <p>Pursuing this logic, we see that a 'benevolent dictator' does not in fact 

      own his entire project unqualifiedly. Though he has the right to make binding 

      decisions, he in effect trades away shares of the total reputation return 

      in exchange for others' work. The analogy with sharecropping on a farm is 

      almost irresistible, except that a contributor's name stays in the credits 

      and continues to 'earn' to some degree even after that contributor is no 

      longer active.</p>

    <p>As benevolent-dictator projects add more participants, they tend to develop 

      two tiers of contributors; ordinary contributors and co-developers. A typical 

      path to becoming a co-developer is taking responsibility for a major subsystem 

      of the project. Another is to take the role of 'lord high fixer', characterizing 

      and fixing many bugs. In this way or others, co-developers are the contributors 

      who make a substantial and continuing investment of time in the project.</p>

    <p>The subsystem-owner role is particularly important for our analysis and 

      deserves further examination. Hackers like to say that 'authority follows 

      responsibility'. A co-developer who accepts maintenance responsibility for 

      a given subsystem generally gets to control both the implementation of that 

      subsystem and its interfaces with the rest of the project, subject only 

      to correction by the project leader (acting as architect). We observe that 

      this rule effectively creates enclosed properties on the Lockean model within 

      a project, and has exactly the same conflict-prevention role as other property 

      boundaries.</p>

    <p>By custom, the 'dictator' or project leader in a project with co-developers 

      is expected to consult with those co-developers on key decisions. This is 

      especially so if the decision concerns a subsystem which a co-developer 

      'owns' (that is, has invested time in and taken responsibility for). A wise 

      leader, recognizing the function of the project's internal property boundaries, 

      will not lightly interfere with or reverse decisions made by subsystem owners.</p>

    <p>Some very large projects discard the 'benevolent dictator' model entirely. 

      One way to do this is turn the co-developers into a voting committee (as 

      with Apache). Another is rotating dictatorship, in which control is occasionally 

      passed from one member to another within a circle of senior co-developers 

      (the Perl developers organize themselves this way).</p>

    <p>Such complicated arrangements are widely considered unstable and difficult. 

      Clearly this perceived difficulty is largely a function of the known hazards 

      of design-by-committee, and of committees themselves; these are problems 

      the hacker culture consciously understands. However, I think some of the 

      visceral discomfort hackers feel about committee or rotating-chair organizations 

      is because they're hard to fit into the unconscious Lockean model hackers 

      use for reasoning about the simpler cases. It's problematic, in these complex 

      organizations, to do an accounting of either ownership in the sense of control 

      or ownership of reputation returns. It's hard to see where the internal 

      boundaries are, and thus hard to avoid conflict unless the group enjoys 

      an exceptionally high level of harmony and trust.</p>

    <h2><img src="../../../buttons/quad.gif"><a name="d16"></a> </h2>

    <h2>Conflict and Conflict Resolution</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>We've seen that within projects, an increasing complexity of roles is expressed 

      by a distribution of design authority and partial property rights. While 

      this is an efficient way to distribute incentives, it also dilutes the authority 

      of the project leader - most importantly, it dilutes the leader's authority 

      to squash potential conflicts.</p>

    <p>While technical arguments over design might seem the most obvious risk 

      for internecine conflict, they are seldom a serious cause of strife. These 

      are usually relatively easily resolved by the territorial rule that authority 

      follows responsibility.</p>

    <p>Another way of resolving conflicts is by seniority - if two contributors 

      or groups of contributors have a dispute, and the dispute cannot be resolved 

      objectively, and neither owns the territory of the dispute, the side that 

      has put the most work into the project as a whole (that is, the side with 

      the most property rights in the whole project) wins.</p>

    <p>These rules generally suffice to resolve most project disputes. When they 

      do not, fiat of the project leader usually suffices. Disputes that survive 

      both these filters are rare.</p>

    <p>Conflicts do not as a rule become serious unless these two criteria ("authority 

      follows responsibility" and "seniority wins") point in different directions, 

      <em>and</em> the authority of the project leader is weak or absent. The 

      most obvious case in which this may occur is a succession dispute following 

      the disappearance of the project lead. I have been in one fight of this 

      kind. It was ugly, painful, protracted, only resolved when all parties became 

      exhausted enough to hand control to an outside person, and I devoutly hope 

      I am never anywhere near anything of the kind again.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, all of these conflict-resolution mechanisms rest on the wider 

      hacker community's willingness to enforce them. The only available enforcement 

      mechanisms are flaming and shunning - public condemnation of those who break 

      custom, and refusal to cooperate with them after they have done so.</p>

    <h2>Acculturation Mechanisms and the Link to Academia</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>An early version of this paper posed the following research question: How 

      does the community inform and instruct its members as to its customs? Are 

      the customs self-evident or self-organizing at a semi-conscious level, are 

      they taught by example, are they taught by explicit instruction?</p>

    <p>Teaching by explicit instruction is clearly rare, if only because few explicit 

      descriptions of the culture's norms have existed to be used up to now.</p>

    <p>Many norms are taught by example. To cite one very simple case, there is 

      a norm that every software distribution should have a file called README 

      or READ.ME that contains first-look instructions for browsing. This convention 

      has been well established since at least the early 1980s, but up to now 

      it has never been written down. One derives it from looking at many distributions.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="raym6.gif" width="387" height="117"></p>

    <p>On the other hand, some hacker customs are self-organizing once one has 

      acquired a basic (perhaps unconscious) understanding of the reputation game. 

      Most hackers never have to be taught the three taboos I listed under the 

      section "Promiscuous Theory, Puritan Practice", or at least would claim 

      if asked that they are self-evident rather than transmitted. This phenomenon 

      invites closer analysis - and perhaps we can find its explanation in the 

      process by which hackers acquire knowledge about the culture.</p>

    <p>Many cultures use hidden clues (more precisely 'mysteries' in the religio-mystical 

      sense) as an acculturation mechanism. These are secrets which are not revealed 

      to outsiders, but are expected to be discovered or deduced by the aspiring 

      newbie. To be accepted inside, one must demonstrate that one both understands 

      the mystery and has learned it in a culturally approved way.</p>

    <p>The hacker culture makes unusually conscious and extensive use of such 

      clues or tests. We can see this process operating at least three levels:</p>

    <p>

    <ul>

      <li>Password-like specific mysteries. As one example, there is a Usenet 

        newsgroup called <tt>alt.sysadmin.recovery</tt> that has a very explicit 

        secret; you cannot post without knowing it, and knowing it is considered 

        evidence you are fit to post. The regulars have a strong taboo against 

        revealing this secret.</li>

      <p></p>

      <p>

      <li>The requirement of initiation into certain technical mysteries. One 

        must absorb a good deal of technical knowledge before one can give valued 

        gifts (e.g. one must know at least one of the major computer languages). 

        This requirement functions in the large in the way hidden clues do in 

        the small, as a filter for qualities (such as capability for abstract 

        thinking, persistence, and mental flexibility) which are necessary to 

        function in the culture.</li>

      <p></p>

      <p>

      <li>Social-context mysteries. One becomes involved in the culture by attaching 

        oneself to specific projects. Each project is a live social context of 

        hackers which the would-be contributor has to investigate and understand 

        socially as well as technically in order to function. Concretely, a common 

        way one does this is by reading the project's Web pages and/or e-mail 

        archives. It is through these project groups that newbies experience the 

        behavioral example of experienced hackers.</li>

    </ul>

    <p></p>

    <p>In the process of acquiring these mysteries, the would-be hacker picks 

      up contextual knowledge which (after a while) makes the three taboos and 

      other customs seem 'self-evident'.</p>

    <p>One might, incidentally, argue that the structure of the hacker gift culture 

      itself is its own central mystery. One is not considered acculturated (concretely: 

      no one will call you a hacker) until one demonstrates a gut-level understanding 

      of the reputation game and its implied customs, taboos, and usages. But 

      this is trivial; all cultures demand such understanding from would-be joiners. 

      Furthermore the hacker culture evinces no desire to have its internal logic 

      and folkways kept secret - or, at least, nobody has ever flamed me for revealing 

      them!</p>

    <p>Respondents to this paper too numerous to list have pointed out that hacker 

      ownership customs seem intimately related to (and may derive directly from) 

      the practices of the academic world, especially the scientific research 

      community. This research community has similar problems in mining a territory 

      of potentially productive ideas, and exhibits very similar adaptive solutions 

      to those problems in the ways it uses peer review and reputation.</p>

    <p>Since many hackers have had formative exposure to academia (it's common 

      to learn how to hack while in college) the extent to which academia shares 

      adaptive patterns with the hacker culture is of more than casual interest 

      in understanding how these customs are applied.</p>

    <p>Obvious parallels with the hacker 'gift culture' as I have characterized 

      it abound in academia. Once a researcher achieves tenure, there is no need 

      to worry about survival issues. Indeed, the concept of tenure can probably 

      be traced back to an earlier gift culture in which "natural philosophers" 

      were primarily wealthy gentlemen with time on their hands to devote to research. 

      In the absence of survival issues reputation enhancement becomes the driving 

      goal, which encourages sharing of new ideas and research through journals 

      and other media. This makes objective functional sense because scientific 

      research, like the hacker culture, relies heavily on the idea of 'standing 

      upon the shoulders of giants', and not having to rediscover basic principles 

      over and over again.</p>

    <p>Some have gone so far as to suggest that hacker customs are merely a reflection 

      of the research community's folkways and are actually (for most) acquired 

      there. This probably overstates the case, if only because hacker custom 

      seems to be readily acquired by intelligent high-schoolers!</p>

    <p>There is a more interesting possibility here. I suspect academia and the 

      hacker culture share adaptive patterns not because they're genetically related, 

      but because they've both evolved the most optimal social organization for 

      what they're trying to do, given the laws of nature and the instinctive 

      wiring of humans. The verdict of history seems to be that free-market capitalism 

      is the globally optimal way to cooperate for economic efficiency; perhaps, 

      in a similar way, the reputation-game gift culture is the globally optimal 

      way to cooperate for generating (and checking!) high-quality creative work.</p>

    <p>This point, if true, is of more than (excuse me) academic interest. It 

      suggests from a slightly different angle one of the speculations in <a href="http://~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The 

      Cathedral And The Bazaar</a>; that, ultimately, the industrial-capitalist 

      mode of software production was doomed to be out-competed from the moment 

      capitalism began to create enough of a wealth surplus for many programmers 

      to live in a post-scarcity gift culture.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: From Custom to Customary Law</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>We have examined the customs which regulate the ownership and control of 

      open-source software. We have seen how they imply an underlying theory of 

      property rights homologous to the Lockean theory of land tenure. We have 

      related that to an analysis of the hacker culture as a 'gift culture' in 

      which participants compete for prestige by giving time, energy, and creativity 

      away. We have examined the implications of this analysis for conflict resolution 

      in the culture.</p>

    <p>The next logical question to ask is "Why does this matter?" Hackers developed 

      these customs without conscious analysis and (up to now) have followed them 

      without conscious analysis. It's not immediately clear that conscious analysis 

      has gained us anything practical - unless, perhaps, we can move from description 

      to prescription and deduce ways to improve the functioning of these customs.</p>

    <p>We have found a close logical analogy for hacker customs in the theory 

      of land tenure under the Anglo-American common-law tradition. Historically 

      [<a href="#06">6</a>], the European tribal cultures that invented this tradition 

      improved their dispute-resolution systems by moving from a system of unarticulated, 

      semi-conscious customs to a body of explicit customary law memorized by 

      tribal wise men - and eventually written down.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, as our population rises and acculturation of all new members becomes 

      more difficult, it is time for the hacker culture to do something analogous 

      - to develop written codes of good practice for resolving the various sorts 

      of disputes that can arise in connection with open-source projects, and 

      a tradition of arbitration in which senior members of the community may 

      be asked to mediate disputes.</p>

    <p>The analysis in this paper suggests the outlines of what such a code might 

      look like, making explicit that which was previously implicit. No such codes 

      could be imposed from above; they would have to be voluntarily adopted by 

      the founders or owners of individual projects. Nor could they be completely 

      rigid, as the pressures on the culture are likely to change over time. Finally, 

      for enforcement of such codes to work, they would have to reflect a broad 

      consensus of the hacker tribe.</p>

    <p>I have begun work on such a code, tentatively titled the "Malvern Protocol" 

      after the little town where I live. If the general analysis in this paper 

      becomes sufficiently widely accepted, I will make the Malvern Protocol publicly 

      available as a model code for dispute resolution. Parties interested in 

      critiquing and developing this code, or just offering feedback on whether 

      they think it's a good idea or not, are invited to <a href="mailto:esr@thyrsus.com">contact 

      me by electronic mail</a>.

    <h2>Questions for Further Research</h2>

    <p> 

    <p>The culture's (and my own) understanding of large projects that don't follow 

      a benevolent-dictator model is weak. Most such projects fail. A few become 

      spectacularly successful and important (Perl, Apache, KDE). Nobody really 

      understands where the difference lies. There's a vague sense abroad that 

      each such project is <em>sui generis</em> and stands or falls on the group 

      dynamic of its particular members, but is this true or are there replicable 

      strategies a group can follow?</p>

    <p>As a matter of observable fact, people who found successful projects gather 

      more prestige than people who do arguably equal amounts of work debugging 

      and assisting with successful projects. Is this a rational valuation of 

      comparative effort, or is it a second-order effect of the unconscious territorial 

      model we have adduced here?

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p> <a name="01">1</a>.In discussing 'ownership' in this section I will use 

      the singular, as though all projects are owned by some one person. It should 

      be understood, however, that projects may be owned by groups. We shall examine 

      the internal dynamics of such groups later in this paper. 

    <p> <a name="02">2</a>. There are some subtleties about rogue patches. One 

      can divide them into 'friendly' and 'unfriendly' types. A 'friendly' patch 

      is designed to be merged back into the project's main-line sources under 

      the maintainer's control (whether or not that merge actually happens); an 

      'unfriendly' one is intended to yank the project in a direction the maintainer 

      doesn't approve. Some projects (notably the Linux kernel itself) are pretty 

      relaxed about friendly patches and even encourage independent distribution 

      of them as part of their beta-test phase. An unfriendly patch, on the other 

      hand, represents a decision to compete with the original and is a serious 

      matter. Maintaining a whole raft of unfriendly patches tends to lead to 

      forking. 

    <p> <a name="03">3</a>. The term 'noosphere' is an obscure term of art in 

      philosophy derived from the Greek 'nous' meaning 'mind', 'spirit', or 'breath'. 

      It is pronounced KNOW-uh-sfeer (two o-sounds, one long and stressed, one 

      short and unstressed tending towards schwa). If one is being excruciatingly 

      correct about one's orthography, it is properly spelled with a dieresis 

      over one 'o' - just don't ask me which one.
