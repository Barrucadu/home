* statusbar? (the bar you see in pretty much every gtk program at the
* bottom. eg firefox)
  consumes too much space (if always visible) for the little it is used.  (+
* you can put only 1 message in it at a time!)
  -> option 1: no statusbar at all. when hovering over a link (or pressing
  -> key to preview the url without changing page) -> show url in tooltip on
  -> page.
  -> option 2: toggle visibility of statusbar on/off when hovering over a
  -> link. since it's at the bottom I don't think it will disturb too much.
* viewing progress/state of pageload?  most programs use statusbar for this.
  -> option 1: titlebar can show a percentage when it's loading a new page.
  -> option 2: toggle a statusbar everytime we start loading a new page.
* uri bar -> yes, even though we can write stuff to the fifo, it can still
* be convenient to change the url manually and stuff, so a widget in uzbl
* itself is good.
* tabs -> yes. you don't have to use them, but you can.
* back/forward/.. buttons? -> no: use keyboard shortcuts.
* searching in a page? not sure.. maybe we can abuse the statusbar for that
* too.
  eg toggle it on when the user wants to search for something and then do
* searching in some vim-like fashion.
  we don't need a gtk text entry widget, just a feedback display of what the
* current command is.
* scrollbar? no: use keyboard shortcuts.  we should however have some info
* about the page length and where we are.
  -> option 1: put a percentage in the window title
  -> option 2: everytime you hit a key to change position, temporarily make
  -> a statusbar visible and put the percentage in the statusbar.
  what will we do with pages who are too wide? horizontal scrolling?
all of the above goes in 1 bar at the top of the program. there should be a
key to toggle visibility of it and one to toggle visibilety + focus on the
entrybar at once.
